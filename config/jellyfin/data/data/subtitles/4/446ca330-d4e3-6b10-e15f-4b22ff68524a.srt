1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,708
I must have fallen asleep.

2
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,708
Looking for Darwin

3
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,750
Miss?

4
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,000
It's nothing.

5
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,708
Let's go.

6
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,250
Good morning, Nishino-san.

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,625
Good morning to you, too!

8
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,833
Good morning, Senpai!

9
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,458
Thank you, good morning.

10
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,041
There was a boy that I despised.

11
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,541
Good morning, Kageno-kun.

12
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,416
His grades were just below average.

13
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,125
Athletically, he was just below average.

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,250
His looks were exceedingly ordinary.

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,458
Good morning,

16
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,666
Nishimura-san.

17
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,791
Excuse me, Kageno-kun.

18
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,666
What is it, Nishimura-san?

19
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,041
My name...

20
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,875
It isn't Nishimura.

21
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,708
What?

22
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,916
#1: The Hated Classmate

23
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,125
My name....

24
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,916
It isn't Nishimura.

25
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,541
What?

26
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,958
It's not Nishimura.

27
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,333
Oh, I got it wrong?

28
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,333
Yes, my name is-

29
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,333
Oh, hold on, I remember now.

30
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,166
You were technically a named NPC, weren't you?

31
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,166
"Named" what?

32
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,708
Sorry, talking to myself.

33
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,375
I'm pretty good at remembering the names

34
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,375
of all the important characters.

35
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,125
But I haven't been getting enough sleep.

36
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,375
So I guess I got careless.

37
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,916
A careless mistake, I see.

38
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,875
You have been in my class,

39
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,875
sitting right next to me for three months.

40
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,208
Three months!

41
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,708
That's okay, everybody makes mistakes.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,458
Yeah, sorry...

43
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,125
Nishitani-san.

44
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,833
I ain't Nishitani, jerk!

45
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,375
It's Nishino.

46
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm Akane Nishino.

47
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,291
Oh, well, see you later, Nishimura-san.

48
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,791
It's Nishino!

49
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:38,791
You went backwards!

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,666
His most unforgivable crime was not

51
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,666
his failure to get my name right.

52
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,541
He never looked at me.

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,083
He turned his eyes in my direction,

54
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:55,083
but they were always distant,

55
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,250
like he was looking at some different, far-off place.

56
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,250
When I realized that about him,

57
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:01,250
my hatred was complete.

58
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,541
Akane! You're playing the lead in the

59
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,541
upcoming Monday-night drama, right?

60
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,833
That's so cool!

61
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,250
How many shows have you done now?

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,416
You're even busier than you were last year!

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,833
Please! I'm so nervous about it, I could die!

64
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,208
I'm definitely gonna watch!

65
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,041
I had done everything in my power to

66
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:19,041
avoid associating with Kageno-kun.

67
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,166
If I could have had my way,

68
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,166
I would have ignored him entirely.

69
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,083
But there were reasons that I wanted to

70
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:25,083
avoid making a big deal of it.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,791
20,553... 20,554... 20 thousand-

72
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,916
When I was in middle school,

73
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,541
I had to take a break from show business

74
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:46,541
because of a scandal.

75
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,708
Stalker Scare

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,958
Ever since the incident...

77
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,708
I've been hiding behind a mask.

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,541
Nuclear...

79
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,250
The limits of living things...

80
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,125
More power...

81
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,250
Will anyone volunteer to tally up

82
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:12,250
the school festival survey answers?

83
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,333
Oh, Sensei, I can-

84
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,208
Oh, but Nishino-san,

85
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:17,208
you have makeup lessons right now.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,416
Because you've been so busy lately.

87
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,958
This is what makes you so darn lovable, Akane.

88
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
Come on, don't laugh so much.

89
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,500
Then, um, you, sitting next to her.

90
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,875
If you would?

91
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,875
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,458
Okay, time for club!

93
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,625
Wanna stop by Mitsugoshi on the way home?

94
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,375
I play the teacher's pet so the teachers will like me.

95
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,833
I play the popular girl so the students will like me.

96
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,541
I've been very careful to make sure no one hates me.

97
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,625
That's how I've lived my life up to this point.

98
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,000
The Young Miss

99
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,708
He's not answering.

100
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,791
I haven't walked home since the incident.

101
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,833
Akane Nishino, I presume?

102
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,458
Why?! How?!

103
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,458
Not again!

104
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
No!

105
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,708
Come on, stop struggling.

106
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,333
It finally kicked in.

107
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,000
All right, get her in the car.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,708
Huh? Don't order me around, outsider.

109
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,708
You know you shouldn't do that:

110
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:53,666
The daughter of the head of the Nishino Zaibatsu,

111
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:53,666
wandering the streets alone at night.

112
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,291
You might get caught by some unsavory characters.

113
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,000
Just stay there and don't try anything.

114
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,000
We sent the ransom note.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,750
As soon as we get the money, you're free to go.

116
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,041
Or that's the cover story, anyway.

117
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,375
Seems like your old man's made a lot of enemies.

118
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,625
Hey, shut it.

119
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Huh?

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,333
You shut it, outsider.

121
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,041
You think you can talk down to me?

122
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,500
I said stop talking, you outdated gangster clichÃ©.

123
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,625
This is so annoying.

124
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,041
I finally caught my lucky break, and now it's all ruined.

125
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,208
Why don't you help me feel better?

126
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,000
Gimme a little fan service.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,291
I'll start with that pretty little mouth of yours.

128
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,750
Don't you dare fight me!

129
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,416
This should be old hat for you.

130
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,416
It's your second time being kidnapped, after all.

131
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,750
And the last guy was a stalker? Right?

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,083
I'll give you much better memories than that other guy.

133
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,208
Stop struggling!

134
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,833
You know no one's coming.

135
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,208
What?

136
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,583
I mean, who's there?!

137
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,625
Who the hell do you think you are?!

138
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,833
Me?

139
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,958
I'm just a Stylish Ruffian Slayer.

140
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,416
Stylish...

141
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,333
...Ruffian Slayer?

142
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't get cute with us, dammit!

143
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,250
Too much pointless movement.

144
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,250
Your guard is way down.

145
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,041
I see...

146
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,541
It looks like you have some idea what you're doing,

147
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,458
Stylish Ruffian Slayer.

148
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:21,166
You know, I've been awfully bored

149
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,166
since I was booted from the army.

150
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,833
Doing these little kiddy abductions,

151
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:25,833
partnering with a lowlife amateur...

152
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,791
This country is too damn peaceful.

153
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,791
I see, this is perfect.

154
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,375
I've always wanted to fight a military man.

155
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,500
I welcome the challenge, Stylish Ruffian Slayer!

156
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,166
Welcome to my crazy, messed up world!

157
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,125
I can't go back now that I know...

158
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,500
how good this feels!

159
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,416
Crowbars are great, Mr. Ex-Military.

160
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,125
They're sturdy and don't break.

161
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,625
They're easy to carry around.

162
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,500
If you end up in police questioning,

163
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,500
you might be able to make excuses.

164
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,083
And best of all...

165
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,875
you can use them like tonfa batons.

166
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,333
Dammit!

167
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,125
You're definitely a good fighter.

168
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,833
But you have a major weakness.

169
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,375
And it's the fact that I'm big enough to crush you!

170
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,458
I just have to protect my head and I'm fine,

171
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,041
but if you take one hit from me, you're done.

172
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,875
You make a good point.

173
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,083
At my current level, an ex-military guy

174
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,083
is still a bit of a challenge.

175
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
That's the reality.

176
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,333
So I should get a little more serious about this.

177
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,541
What?!

178
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,250
I discovered the real potential of crowbars.

179
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,291
They're shaped very much like tonfa.

180
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,208
They're heavy, sturdy, and portable.

181
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,833
Everything about them has immense potential.

182
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,333
Then I made it a regular practice to

183
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:06,333
beat up the motorcycle gangs

184
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
that disturbed the peace night after night.

185
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,458
You...

186
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,083
You beat up bikers with a crowbar?

187
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,500
You're the Balaclava Berserker?!

188
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,583
They recently started wearing helmets,

189
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,541
so it wouldn't kill them if I hit them in the head.

190
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,625
And...

191
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,208
the solution I found to that problem...

192
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,583
was to stop using the crowbars like tonfa.

193
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,583
Because using it like a regular club...

194
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,291
...is more effective!

195
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,000
That is the potential of a crowbar.

196
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,750
The trick is to hit with the heel of the "L..."

197
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,166
...because it magnifies the shock.

198
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,958
N-no, don't!

199
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,875
Stop...

200
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,000
Next time, be more careful walking home.

201
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,833
What?

202
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,416
It's no good.

203
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,541
If that's how I do against an ex-soldier,

204
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,541
I'll never make it.

205
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,083
I'll never be the Eminence in Shadow.

206
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,708
After that, I called the police,

207
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,708
and things got pretty hectic.

208
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,958
But Daddy pulled some strings,

209
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,458
and the public never found out about what happened.

210
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:49,833
In the end, I never did discover the true identity

211
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,833
of the Stylish Ruffian Slayer.

212
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,250
Good morning, Nishino-san!

213
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,041
Good morning to you, too!

214
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,916
Good morning, Senpai!

215
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,625
Thank you, good morning.

216
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,791
Good morning, Kageno-kun.

217
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,125
Good morning,

218
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,000
Nishino-san.

219
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,708
Okay, okay, my name isn't Nishino-

220
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,125
He didn't get my name wrong.

221
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,458
And I got the feeling his eyes

222
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:27,458
were looking directly at me.

223
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,208
"Kageno-kun is like me.

224
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:33,208
He lives his life hiding behind a mask."

225
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,708
That's the thought that crossed my mind.

226
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,333
But now there's no way to ever know for sure.

227
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,750
On to our next story.

228
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,333
Just before dawn this morning, on a city road in Sakurazaka,

229
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:51,000
local high school student Minoru Kageno-san was hit by a truck.

230
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,250
He did not survive.

231
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,791
The police have determined that the driver

232
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,791
was not watching the road,

233
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,541
and have begun to investigate-

234
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,375
I don't remember how it started.

235
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,666
As far back as I can remember,

236
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,666
it's what I always wanted to be.

237
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,708
Like how everybody dreams of being a hero

238
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:12,708
when they're a kid.

239
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,166
That's what I wanted to be.

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,958
But what made me different from other kids,

241
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,458
is that my passion was far from a temporary phase.

242
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,333
It kept burning, deep, deep inside my heart.

243
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:30,208
The flame never went out.

244
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:30,208
It kept driving me forward.

245
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:35,333
I did everything I could to master

246
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:35,333
every skill I needed to be stronger.

247
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,750
At school, I was the stubbornly ordinary,

248
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,916
never conspicuous, utterly harmless,

249
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:41,916
Background Character A.

250
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,625
But behind the mask, I gave everything to my training.

251
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:51,250
As everyone around me grew up and

252
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:51,250
forgot about the heroes they dreamed of becoming,

253
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,083
I started to feel a little - just a very little - sentimental.

254
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,291
But I kept going, I kept working,

255
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,916
for the day I knew would come.

256
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,458
But the time has come for me to face reality.

257
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,333
None of this is going to mean anything.

258
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,875
The world is overflowing with martial arts,

259
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,875
and I can learn all of them,

260
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,083
but I'll never get the kind of overwhelming power

261
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:16,083
you hear about in all the stories.

262
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,833
The best I can do is bust a few delinquent heads.

263
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,625
If, for example, I was surrounded

264
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:25,625
by fully armed soldiers,

265
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,833
that would be it for me.

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,458
Well, if I became the

267
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,458
strongest martial artist in the world,

268
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:35,125
there's a chance I'd be able to rough 'em up some.

269
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,666
But then what?

270
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,625
What if a nuclear missile fell from the sky?

271
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,833
I can tone my muscles, I can hone my mind,

272
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,833
I can polish my skills all I want.

273
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,666
But if a nuclear bomb hits, all I can do is evaporate.

274
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,958
That's what it is to be human.

275
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,208
I have to overcome those limits.

276
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,250
The being that I want to be

277
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,125
would not evaporate in a nuclear explosion.

278
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,166
Compromise is not an option.

279
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,583
Don't worry.

280
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,083
We have them completely surrounded.

281
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,416
They have nowhere to run.

282
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,583
It's exactly as you predicted, My Lord.

283
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,291
I have only words of admiration for

284
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:46,291
your foresight and meticulous planning.

285
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,500
We haven't had a big hunt in ages.

286
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,500
I can't wait!

287
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
I'll show no mercy.

288
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,458
We're all waiting for your orders, My Lord.

289
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,125
Excellent.

290
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,291
I'm not sure exactly what's excellent,

291
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:07,291
but I'm sure that it is.

292
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,208
I was blessed with a new life,

293
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:11,208
and in a new world, no less.

294
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
And I was given...

295
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:18,041
I need more power.

296
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,875
...magic.

297
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,625
With this new power at my disposal...

298
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,250
There is but one summit we aim to reach.

299
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,833
Let's go.

300
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,291
This time, I'm going to make it.

301
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,958
I would give up everything to get there.

302
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,833
No, I will give up everything!

303
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,541
If that's what it takes to get there,

304
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:55,541
that's how badly I want it.

305
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,916
I don't want to be the hero.

306
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,250
I don't want to be the last boss.

307
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,208
I want to be the one in the story who

308
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,208
operates from the shadows,

309
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,375
showing everyone their greatness:

310
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,625
The Eminence in Shadow!
