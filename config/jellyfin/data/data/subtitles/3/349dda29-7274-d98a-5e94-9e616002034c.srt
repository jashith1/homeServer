1
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:57,017
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

2
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,854
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

3
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>The dream I must have had
I can never recall.</i>

4
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,027
<i>But...</i>

5
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:08,528
<i>But...</i>

6
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,865
<i>the sensation that I've lost something</i>

7
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:15,660
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

8
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,545
<i>I'm always searching</i>

9
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,048
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

10
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:33,428
<i>This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...</i>

11
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,849
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

12
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,809
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

13
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,812
<i>as if a scene from a dream.</i>

14
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,065
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

15
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,568
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

16
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:53,073
<i>Ah, if only our voices speak at night</i>

17
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:59,579
<i>could ever reach the very edge of this World,
and the time</i>

18
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:04,459
<i>Instead of fading into air and dust</i>

19
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:10,423
<i>Then what will the words could ever be?
farthest words from 'probably'</i>

20
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,805
<i>Let's make a promise, that will never fade
Let's say it together in count of three, oh</i>

21
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,735
<i>Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish
will be heard</i>

22
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:34,656
<i>But lately I lost sight of the truth in those words</i>

23
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,493
<i>I can't even remember when I gave up believing
What could have been the reason?</i>

24
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:44,165
<i>Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop
And the place rainbow born and dies</i>

25
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,334
<i>And where the end of this life lies</i>

26
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,505
<i>I've always been insisting
there was something that I've longing for</i>

27
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:59,806
<i>One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented</i>

28
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:04,477
<i>We'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time</i>

29
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:10,191
<i>The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you, dear</i>

30
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:14,195
<i>Let's make a sign for when we say
"nice to meet you" again</i>

31
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:19,451
<i>I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name</i>

32
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,022
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

33
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,317
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

34
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,571
My name <i>is...</i>

35
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:58,990
Mitsuha!

36
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,487
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

37
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,032
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

38
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,993
What? "Mitsuha"?

39
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,704
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

40
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,873
Hurry up!

41
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:10,228
What? What?

42
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,490
Do you want last night's leftovers'?

43
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:24,033
You can have it.

44
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,202
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

45
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:27,871
Mitsuha, you're late!

46
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,164
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

47
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,088
Is this too much?

48
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:38,756
Oh well.

49
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,675
You're normal today.

50
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,094
You were nuts yesterday.

51
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,346
What are you talking about'?

52
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,101
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

53
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,772
<i>This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.</i>

54
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,776
<i>Regarding the mayoral election</i>

55
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:03,448
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

56
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:06,993
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

57
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:17,045
<i>The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

58
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,047
Just make it up with him.

59
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,423
It's an adult matter.

60
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,801
<i>“Posmon of Comet Tiamat“ ...JAXA are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

61
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,154
We're going now!

62
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,468
Study hard!

63
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,058
Mitsuha!

64
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,060
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

65
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,103
Morning.

66
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,064
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

67
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,857
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

68
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,151
You two get along so well.

69
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,611
We do not!

70
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,574
Your hair looks all right today.

71
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,742
What?

72
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,579
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you'?
- Exorcise'?

73
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:35,456
You were totally possessed!

74
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,962
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

75
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,798
Huh'? What are you talking about?

76
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,091
You don't remember?

77
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,094
And above all,

78
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:53,766
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

79
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,060
Only when these are achieved

80
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,605
can a safe and secure community
be created!

81
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,191
As the incumbent mayor...

82
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,028
He'll be reelected again anyway.

83
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,613
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

84
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,699
Hey, Miyamizu.

85
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:10,950
Morning.

86
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,912
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

87
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,122
Ew.

88
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,878
Mitsuha!

89
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,756
Stand up straight!

90
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,634
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

91
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,137
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

92
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,639
Mitsuha.

93
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,559
In front of everybody...

94
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,147
"Who are you?"

95
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,364
" Tasokare"

96
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:59,957
Twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

97
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,671
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

98
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:10,051
Older expressions include
"karetaso-doki"

99
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:10,968
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

100
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:20,228
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

101
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,730
I've heard that ltomori's elderly
still use classical language.

102
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,655
OK next, Mitsuha.

103
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,156
Yes.

104
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,202
Oh, so you remember your name today.

105
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,206
You don't remember?

106
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,420
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

107
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:49,382
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

108
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,512
What? No way! Really?

109
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,931
It was like you had amnesia.

110
00:09:57,056 --> 00:10:01,394
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

111
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,897
A dream about someone else's life'?

112
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,109
I can't remember clearly.

113
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,695
I know! That was...

114
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,029
your previous life!

115
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:16,159
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

116
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,451
Stay out of this.

117
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:21,122
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

118
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,208
Nothing.

119
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:28,921
But Mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

120
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,174
You been feeling alright?

121
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,386
That's so strange. I feel fine.

122
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:39,348
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it'?

123
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,059
Oh, don't remind me!

124
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,437
I can't stand this town anymore.

125
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:50,735
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

126
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:55,740
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

127
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,410
Trains come every <i>2</i> hours.

128
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,454
The store closes at 9 p.m.

129
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,414
No bookstore. No dentist.

130
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,958
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"
But <i>2</i> pubs for some reason.

131
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,084
No jobs.

132
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,211
No brides.

133
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,213
Short sunlight hours.

134
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:14,759
- Give me a break!
- What?

135
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,387
I mean... How about we stop by a café?

136
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,722
- A café?
- Really?

137
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,224
Where?

138
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,604
Hello.

139
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,439
Hello.

140
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,612
This is a café?

141
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,739
You knew there wasn't one.

142
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,408
Mitsuha just went home.

143
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,995
Things must be rough for her.

144
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,456
Well, she takes center stage.

145
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,958
Yeah.

146
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,295
Hey, Tessie.

147
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,089
What?

148
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,925
What will you do after you graduate'?

149
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,803
What's this?
You asking about my future?

150
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:06,102
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

151
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,786
I'd rather do that too.

152
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,539
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

153
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,000
Listen to the thread's voice.

154
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,336
When you keep twining like that,

155
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,674
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

156
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,301
Threads don't talk.

157
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,594
She means, "Concentrate."

158
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,392
1,000 years of ltomori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

159
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:50,313
Listen. 200 years ago...

160
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,064
Here she goes again.

161
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:58,821
Sandal maker Mayugords bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

162
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,283
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

163
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,993
and this is known as...

164
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,037
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

165
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,999
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

166
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:16,672
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

167
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,635
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

168
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:26,140
That's the important task
we at Miyamizu Shrine have.

169
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,855
But that foolish son-in-law...

170
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:38,069
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough,

171
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,072
now politics'? He's hopeless.

172
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,532
Have another, my man.

173
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,954
I'm counting on your help again.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,289
Leave it to me.

175
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,168
You'll get votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.

176
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,586
How's it going with her?

177
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:57,755
It's not that easy.

178
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:01,467
I smell corruption.

179
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,302
Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,971
Bring us a few more hot <i>sake.</i>

181
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,264
OK.

182
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,934
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

183
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:12,186
Learn how to use explosives.

184
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,313
Can't hear you.

185
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,314
Yes!

186
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,956
We both have it rough, don't we?

187
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,102
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

188
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,855
They're both pretty like their mother.

189
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:58,607
<i>Hey-</i>

190
00:14:58,983 --> 00:14:59,817
<i>Hey-</i>

191
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,643
It's the oldest sake in the world.

192
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:40,608
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

193
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:45,654
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
<i>sake</i> made that way?

194
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,531
Of course they do.

195
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,869
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

196
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,793
Oh! I could never do that!

197
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,587
Isn't she embarrassed?

198
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,464
I can't believe it.

199
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:22,775
Cheer up, Mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you'?

200
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,986
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

201
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:30,866
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

202
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,494
Where do you get such ideas'?

203
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:38,874
Sell them with photos and making videos.
Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sake."

204
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,751
You'll make money!

205
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,837
"Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake"</i>

206
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,590
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

207
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,885
That's the problem'?

208
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:01,146
I hate this town! I hate this life!

209
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:05,568
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

210
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,740
What a fool...

211
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:40,603
9w!

212
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,441
<i>Ouch...</i>

213
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,326
Where...

214
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,631
Somethings there...

215
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,520
9w!

216
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,689
Taki! Are you up'?

217
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,195
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

218
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,529
I'm sorry.

219
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,368
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

220
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,535
OK.

221
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:42,498
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

222
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,376
Have a nice day.

223
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,763
What a strange dream.

224
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,393
"From Tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

225
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:07,398
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

226
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,076
I have to use the bathroom.

227
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,795
This is too realistic.

228
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,139
"Shinjuku Station"

229
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,035
I'm in Tokyo.

230
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,666
"Jingu High School"

231
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,668
- Where'd you get it'?
- Daikanyama.

232
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,670
The front act at the next gig...

233
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,673
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

234
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,679
Taki!

235
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,476
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

236
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,145
You ignored my text.

237
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,022
Oh, Tsukasa?

238
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,942
At least you sound apologetic.

239
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,946
- You got lost'?
- Yeah.

240
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,699
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

241
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,370
- Uh... Well... I...
- Feminine?

242
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,913
I!

243
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,623
<i>L</i>?

244
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:30,958
<i>L</i>?

245
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:38,882
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

246
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,468
You seem to have a dialect.

247
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,720
Where's your lunch?

248
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,849
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

249
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,060
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

250
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,816
Thank you.

251
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,069
Let's go to a café.

252
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,738
Oh that one? OK. Coming, Taki?

253
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,533
What? What? What?

254
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:06,326
A café?

255
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,415
Nice timberwork up there.

256
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,709
Yeah, attention to detail.

257
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,377
Taki, have you decided'?

258
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,841
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

259
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,677
What age are you from again?

260
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,598
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

261
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,939
What a great dream.

262
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,364
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

263
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,783
Your shift is today?

264
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,952
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

265
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,372
<i>Oh! Um...</i>

266
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,293
Where do I work'?

267
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,878
What?

268
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,219
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

269
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,430
Table 12! Taki!

270
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,891
Here you go.

271
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:13,894
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

272
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,395
We didn't order that.

273
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,898
Taki, I said no more truffles!

274
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,900
Taki, can't hear you!

275
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,901
Taki!

276
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,905
When is this dream going to end'?

277
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,624
Hey. Hey waiter.

278
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,917
Oh, yes?

279
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,838
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

280
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,425
We could have gotten hurt.

281
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:50,013
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

282
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,182
Uh, well...

283
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:57,020
But... There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

284
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,107
Excuse me.

285
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,401
Is everything OK?

286
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:04,444
I'll handle this.

287
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,115
What's wrong with you today'?

288
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,703
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

289
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,829
Oh, really'?

290
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,081
I hope you weren't hurt.

291
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,384
Um...

292
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,885
Okudera...

293
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:29,928
Ms.Okudera.

294
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,015
Ms.Okudera. Thank you...

295
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,558
A stroke of bad luck today.

296
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:35,684
No, uh...

297
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,227
Bet it was a set-up.

298
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,856
Handled it according to the manual, but...

299
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,401
Oh, Ms.Okudera, your skirt!

300
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,737
You OK'?

301
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,739
- What happened'?
- Slashed.

302
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,741
That dick from earlier'?

303
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,285
What now? Do you remember his face?

304
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,661
No.

305
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,496
Come with me.

306
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,415
Hey, Taki!

307
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,084
Take off your skirt.

308
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,545
Oh! I'll look the other way!

309
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,718
This won't take long.

310
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,182
Done!

311
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,936
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

312
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,233
Thank you for saving me today.

313
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,447
Actually, I was concerned about you.

314
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,700
You're weak but quick-tempered.

315
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,453
I like you better today.

316
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,791
Never knew you had a feminine side.

317
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,960
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

318
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:55,055
What a realistic dream
if I say so myself.

319
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,478
Oh, he keeps a diary.

320
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,984
He's so organized.

321
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,737
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

322
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,492
Oh! That's her!

323
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,874
A crush, maybe'?

324
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:34,511
"Walked to the station with Ms.Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

325
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,347
"Who are you?"

326
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:50,861
"I\/litsu ha"

327
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,878
What is this'?

328
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,379
"I\/litsu ha"

329
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,885
Wha...? Wha...?

330
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,928
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on'?

331
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,806
Let's go to a café again.

332
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,225
Sorry, I have to go to work.

333
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,227
Do you remember where to go'?

334
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:30,150
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

335
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,737
Oh, never mind. See you.

336
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,532
He's acting normal today.

337
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,368
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

338
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:41,244
What?

339
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,082
Wha... What?

340
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,460
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

341
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,253
You walked home with her!

342
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,550
Did I really? With Ms.Okudera?

343
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,260
What happened afterwards?

344
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,764
I don't really remember.

345
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,349
Oh really, now?

346
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,935
Coming through.

347
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,771
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

348
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,024
Let's make this a good one.

349
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,276
Right, Taki'?

350
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:26,373
"Mitsuha? Who are you'?
What are you?"

351
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,876
You're not touching your boobs today.

352
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,379
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

353
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,175
Boobs?

354
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,387
Morning.

355
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,479
Why is everyone staring at me'?

356
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,983
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

357
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:53,650
Huh?

358
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,111
"Still life drawing"

359
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,574
Doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

360
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,828
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

361
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,164
They mean me, right?

362
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,958
Well, yeah.

363
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,335
Hey, Mitsuha!

364
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:27,017
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

365
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:30,729
Mitsuha'?

366
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,488
Is <i>this... Could</i> this <i>be...</i>

367
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,410
Could this be that we're really...

368
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,912
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

369
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,832
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

370
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,501
switching places?

371
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:31,122
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

372
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:34,376
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

373
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,587
<i>I switch with Mitsuha at random,</i>

374
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,631
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

375
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,591
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

376
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:48,807
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

377
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:52,310
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

378
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:56,314
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...</i>

379
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,109
<i>So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

380
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:01,736
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

381
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:15,500
<i>To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

382
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,460
<i>But...</i>

383
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,003
<i>But...</i>

384
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,756
- That girl!
- That guy!

385
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,691
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

386
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,947
<i>Stop wasting my MOFIBY!</i>

387
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,867
<i>It's YOUR body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

388
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,284
"Braided cords..."

389
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,996
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

390
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,664
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

391
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,355
<i>Grabbed coffee with Ms.Okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

392
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,901
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

393
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,404
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

394
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,449
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

395
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:30,033
<i>Don't be full of yourself!
Not like YOU have a girlfriend!</i>

396
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,703
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

397
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,580
"Fool/Idiot"

398
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,624
I'm single because I want to be!

399
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,356
I shouldn't for her sake.

400
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,695
You sure do like your boobs.

401
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,198
We're going now! Get ready!

402
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:17,413
<i>Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

403
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,207
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

404
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:19,958
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

405
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,757
<i>So it can be seen above Venus...</i>

406
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,717
Why the uniform?

407
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:42,689
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away'?

408
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,317
I don't know because of Mayugoro.

409
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:47,777
Who's that?

410
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,237
What? He's famous!

411
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,789
Here, Grandma.

412
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,754
Whoa, Mitsuha.

413
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,769
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?

414
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,313
Musu bi?

415
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:28,568
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

416
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,779
This word has profound meaning.

417
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:37,744
Tying thread is Musubi.
Connecting people is Musubi.

418
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,288
The flow of time is Musubi.

419
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,666
These are all the god's power.

420
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,420
So the braided cords that we make

421
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,967
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

422
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:56,304
They converge and take shape.

423
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,556
They twist, tangle

424
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:03,186
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

425
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:07,815
Musub/ - knotting. That's time.

426
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,362
Drink.

427
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,821
Thank you.

428
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:15,948
I want some too!

429
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:18,326
That's also Musubi.

430
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,372
Whether it be water, rice, or <i>sake,</i>

431
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:27,835
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

432
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,505
So today's offering

433
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,344
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

434
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:39,889
Hey, I see it!

435
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:47,230
That's the body
of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

436
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,625
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

437
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,586
It means the underworld.

438
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,089
It's the underworld!

439
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:20,888
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

440
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,266
what is most important to you.

441
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,145
The kuchikamisake.

442
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,647
The kuchikamisake?

443
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:33,651
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

444
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:37,447
It's half of you.

445
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,367
<i>HalfofM/'tsuha.</i> ..

446
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,345
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.

447
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,431
Katawa re-doki'?

448
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:14,859
Oh yeah,

449
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,819
maybe I can see the comet.

450
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,822
The comet?

451
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,449
<i>Oh,</i>

452
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,451
Mitsuha,

453
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,954
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

454
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,843
Tears? Why?

455
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:45,473
"L'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

456
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:49,477
Ms.Okudera'? What's she talking about'?

457
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,688
What did Mitsuha do this time?

458
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,483
A date?

459
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:06,035
<i>A date with Ms.Okudera tomorrow!</i>

460
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:08,496
<i>Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!</i>

461
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:13,501
...was what I'd planned, but...

462
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:28,516
Taki.

463
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:31,602
Sorry. Did you wait long?

464
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,271
Yes. No...

465
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,481
Um...

466
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,241
I just got here.

467
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,535
Good. Let's go.

468
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,124
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

469
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:58,004
Hey?

470
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,551
Loci

471
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,761
Why?

472
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,562
<i>I wanted to go on this date,</i>

473
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:20,067
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

474
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:29,076
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before,</i>

475
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:33,122
I don't know what to say...

476
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:37,543
<i>so below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

477
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:38,961
Really?

478
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,338
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

479
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,843
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting."

480
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,346
She's making fun of me.

481
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:52,350
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

482
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,376
Taki...

483
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,838
You're like a different person today.

484
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:37,395
Urn, Ms.Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

485
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,856
Let's call it a day.

486
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,693
Yes.

487
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:47,363
<i>Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.</i>

488
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:52,410
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right'?

489
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,914
But now you like someone else.

490
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,543
No I don't!

491
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:01,460
Really?

492
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,921
No! That's not true at all.

493
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,007
I wonder.

494
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,803
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

495
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:30,698
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

496
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,412
What is she saying?

497
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:43,210
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

498
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,234
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

499
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:13,783
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

500
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:18,162
What? The festival? Well...

501
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:24,210
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it'?

502
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,755
OK, got it. Later, then.

503
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:33,135
You just want to see her in ayukata.

504
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,221
What!? No!

505
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,348
That didn't even occur to me.

506
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,477
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

507
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,604
Maybe you annoyed her.

508
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:44,814
Come on!

509
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,856
Sorry I'm late.

510
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,399
- Here she is!
- Finally!

511
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,822
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

512
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:55,116
Your hair!

513
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,953
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

514
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:11,006
You think some guy is the reason?
Ditched, maybe?

515
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:13,968
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

516
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,470
She said she just felt like it.

517
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:20,015
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

518
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:22,977
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

519
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,581
WOW!

520
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:07,146
<i>The number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned off...</i>

521
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:15,404
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,</i>

522
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:18,282
<i>I thought. But...</i>

523
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:21,160
<i>For some reason, after that,</i>

524
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:26,040
<i>Mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

525
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,078
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

526
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:16,507
"Hida mountains"

527
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:23,615
What the... What are you doing here'?

528
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,996
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

529
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:38,130
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

530
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:39,506
Takagi will cover your shift.

531
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,760
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

532
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:44,887
This isn't funny.

533
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:47,306
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

534
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,559
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

535
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:51,810
A con act?

536
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,104
You're meeting an online friend.

537
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,565
Well no, not exactly...

538
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:58,901
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

539
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:03,489
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

540
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:05,282
I'm not a kid!

541
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:12,122
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

542
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,794
<i>So I decided to go see Mitsuha
in person.</i>

543
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:20,047
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

544
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:27,596
What? You don't know where'?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

545
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:28,555
Yes.

546
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,937
And you can't contact her'?
What's this all about'?

547
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,773
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

548
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,108
I did not plan a tour!

549
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:42,569
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

550
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:45,739
Oh how cute! Look!

551
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:46,907
So annoying.

552
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,076
Oh, it moved!

553
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:19,231
So it's impossible after all...

554
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:23,110
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

555
00:48:25,988 --> 00:48:28,282
You haven't done anything.

556
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,078
A Takayama ramen.

557
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:34,621
A Takayama ramen.

558
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,457
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

559
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,668
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

560
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:44,214
Can we return to Tokyo today'?

561
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,509
We could be cutting it close.
I'll check.

562
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:48,385
Thanks.

563
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,846
Are you all right with that?

564
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:57,728
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

565
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:05,486
Why young man,
that's ltomori, isn't it'?

566
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:10,032
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

567
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,204
Yeah, it's ltomori.
Brings back memories.

568
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,539
He was born in ltomori.

569
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,124
Itomori...?

570
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:25,631
Yes! ltomori Town! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

571
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,550
- What are you...
- ltomori <i>was...</i>

572
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:31,553
ltomori? No way!

573
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:34,348
Is it where that comet"?

574
00:49:42,439 --> 00:49:45,317
"Keep Out"

575
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,942
Hey. ls this really the place?

576
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:30,946
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

577
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,741
No. I'm sure this is it.

578
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,455
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

579
00:50:40,622 --> 00:50:42,374
That can't be true!

580
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:47,754
Surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

581
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:49,881
Died?

582
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,386
Died 3 years ago?

583
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:57,639
That can't be.

584
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:02,227
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

585
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,246
They're disappearing...

586
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:33,467
Cornet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

587
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:41,767
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town" Nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

588
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,020
"Town Annihilated"

589
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:46,772
"Over 500 dead or missing"

590
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,273
"ltomori, the Town that Vanished"

591
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:53,278
A fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Japan.

592
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,572
"Itomori, comet, damage"

593
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,912
The point of impact was here.

594
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:08,293
At 8:42 <i>p.m.,</i> it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

595
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,172
"List of the Names of Victims"

596
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,554
and now nobody lives in ltomori anymore.

597
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:31,316
Tessie and Sayaka...

598
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:35,654
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

599
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:42,661
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

600
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:48,959
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible.

601
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,085
So...

602
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,878
<i>You're dreaming now...</i>

00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:55,340

606
00:52:59,428 --> 00:53:00,762
What did l...?

607
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,778
Lively up there.

608
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,489
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

609
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:20,866
No problem.

610
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,076
How's Taki?

611
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:26,496
He's still reading articles on ltomori.

612
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:29,875
Newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems.

613
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:38,300
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

614
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:42,095
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

615
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,307
What do you think about Taki's story?

616
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:50,979
I liked him.

617
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:57,444
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

618
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,782
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

619
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:06,912
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to <i>me...</i>

620
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:14,836
But I'm sure he met someone
and that someone changed him.

621
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:17,005
That much is for sure, I think.

622
00:54:32,896 --> 00:54:34,940
It was all just a dream.

623
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:42,614
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

624
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,701
If not that, then... a ghost?

625
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:51,957
No... Was I fantasizing?

626
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:59,297
Her name... What was it'?

627
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:04,469
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

628
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:08,473
Oh, Ms.Okudera. I, <i>uh...</i>

629
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:14,479
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

630
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:19,985
No problem.

631
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,695
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

632
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,488
"Braided Cords of ltomori"

633
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,911
ls that a braided cord you're wearing'?

634
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:36,001
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

635
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:40,297
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

636
00:55:42,883 --> 00:55:44,009
Who was it?

637
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:49,264
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

638
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:51,308
<i>Yes. ...No.</i>

639
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:58,773
Someone who makes braided cords
told me before...

640
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,985
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

641
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:08,116
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

642
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:12,329
Maybe at that place...

643
00:56:29,638 --> 00:56:31,181
"Around here?"

644
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,064

<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

"I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

649
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,595
Taki...

650
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:36,371
Eat this up there.

651
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:41,376
Your drawing of ltomori... It was good.

652
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:23,752
<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,</i>

653
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:27,422
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

654
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:32,927
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

655
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:44,689
There it is!

656
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,359
It's really there!

657
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:52,363
It wasn't just a dream!

658
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:25,897
From here is the underworld.

659
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,881
It's the <i>sake</i> we brought.

660
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:56,511
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

661
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:05,937
Before the comet struck... So the
Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

662
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:10,942
Our timelines weren't in step.

663
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:15,155
Half of her...

664
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,879
Musubi.

665
01:00:32,422 --> 01:00:35,091
If time can really be turned back,

666
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:38,344
give me one last chance...

667
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,776
The comet!

668
01:01:59,175 --> 01:02:02,136
Your name is Mitsuha.

669
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:10,770
You're both my treasures.

670
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,314
You're a big sister now.

671
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:15,900
"Get well soon, Mom."

672
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,569
I'm so sorry, my dears.

673
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:23,700
Dad, when is Mom going to come home?

674
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:26,035
I couldn't save her.

675
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,079
Get a hold of yourself!

676
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:29,455
Who cares about the shrine'?

677
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,249
You're the adopted son-in-law!

678
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:34,460
I loved my wife Futaba.
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

679
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:36,045
Get out of here!

680
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:41,009
Ivlitsu ha, Yotsu ha,

681
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:44,679
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

682
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:50,393

Who am I? No, who are you'?

What? Hey, Mitsuha!

688
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,705
Grandma, could you do me a favor'?

689
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,167
Oh yeah, the comet.

690
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,879
Today's the peak of its brightness...

691
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,006
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

692
01:03:21,174 --> 01:03:25,553
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

697
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:09,472
Mitsuha, are you touching...

698
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,143
My sister!

Mitsuha has finally lost it.

701

I'm leaving without her.

702
01:04:27,115 --> 01:04:29,075
She's lost it.

703
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,744
She's completely lost it.

its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,</i>

707
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:44,424
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

708
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:47,427
It's tonight. There's still time.

709
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:49,804
Good morning, Mitsuha.

710
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:51,639
<i>Oh...</i>

711
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:55,351
You're not Mitsuha, are you'?

712
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,647
You knew, Grandma'?

713
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:06,195
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

714
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:12,702
I also remember seeing strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

715
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:19,750
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

716
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,627
Forgotten...

717
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:26,716
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

718
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:31,721
There were times your mother and I
had similar experiences.

719
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:36,434
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

720
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:40,188
were all for what will happen today.

721
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:42,732
Grandma, listen.

722
01:05:43,191 --> 01:05:48,112
A comet will strike ltomori tonight
and everyone will die.

723
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:00,708
<i>"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, Grandma.</i>

724
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:03,544
I won't let them die!

725
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,215
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

726
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,636
Your... your hair!

727
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:14,305
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh'?

728
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,890
Oh, that's it?

729
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:20,186
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

730
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,607
So we have to act!

731
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,113
Why aren't you at school?

732
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:35,952
<i>Uh...</i> We have to save the town.

733
01:06:37,578 --> 01:06:38,746
The community wireless system?

734
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:41,374
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

735
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:44,877
"Superimposition, frequency"

736
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:49,924
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

737
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,552
Hey! Don't come so close!

738
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:54,762
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

739
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,932
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

740
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:00,142
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

741
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,442
Got them. Here's your change.

742
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:09,860
Sorry, Sayaka.

743
01:07:09,986 --> 01:07:11,362
It's all right.

744
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,906
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

745
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:19,870
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

746
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:25,585
What? A bomb'?

747
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:30,256
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

748
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:31,757
Broadcast hijacking?

749
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:37,096
The town's wireless system can be easily
jacked using the startup frequency.

750
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:40,683
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

751
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:45,980
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

752
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:49,275
It's... It's totally a crime!

753
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,943
You do the broadcast.

754
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,654
- Why'?
- You're in the broadcast club.

755
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:55,448
I'm in charge of explosives.

756
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:57,658
I'll go talk to the mayor.

757
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,038
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

758
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:05,166
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

759
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:07,460
It's a perfect plan.

760
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:13,215
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it'?

761
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,676
What? Well...

762
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,722
Not necessarily! Do you know
how Lake ltomori was formed?

763
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:20,348
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

764
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:27,480
Oh! So that's why...

765
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,857
You're right, Tessie!

766
01:08:33,653 --> 01:08:35,488
Let's do it together!

767
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:41,994
What on earth are you talking about?

768
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:47,708
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

769
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,001
Shut your mouth.

770
01:08:54,924 --> 01:08:58,010
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

771
01:08:58,135 --> 01:08:58,511
"It0m0ri Town Hall"

772
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:04,016
How dare you spout such nonsense'?

773
01:09:05,017 --> 01:09:07,603
If you're serious, then you're sick.

774
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,023
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

775
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:16,654
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

776
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:20,866
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

777
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:25,621
You son of a...!

778
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:37,967
Mitsuha! No...

779
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:40,094
<i>Who...</i>

780
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,222
Who are you?

781
01:09:57,445 --> 01:09:59,447
See you later at the festival.

782
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,323
Let's meet at the shrine.

783
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:02,491
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

784
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,160
- See you.
- Later.

785
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,163
You shouldn't go!

786
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:10,166
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

787
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:11,542
What are you saying?

788
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:12,668
Mitsuha!

789
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,129
- What was that?
- Let's go.

790
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:17,631
What are you doing?

791
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,925
Could Mitsuha...

792
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:23,679
Could she have persuaded them?
ls it my fault?

793
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,933
Yotsuha, leave town with Grandma
before nightfall.

794
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:29,977
You'll die if you stay here!

795
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,021
What are you saying?

796
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:36,567
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

797
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:39,653
Tokyo?

798
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:42,615
Hey, Mitsuha!

799
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:46,952
How did it go with your old man'?

800
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,748
Hey, Mitsuha?

801
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:52,583
What's wrong with her?

802
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,834
No idea.

803
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,554
Are you there?

804
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,974
Is something over there?

805
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,643
Let me use your bike.

806
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:11,769
Hey, what the...

807
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:13,103
Hey, Mitsuha!

808
01:11:14,355 --> 01:11:15,689
What about our plan'?

809
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,691
Get ready as planned!

810
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,735
Please!

811
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:48,222
I'm Taki again.

812
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,562
What's Taki doing here?

813
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:04,363
<i>The town...</i>

814
01:12:05,573 --> 01:12:06,699
is gone.

815
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:19,920
At that moment... did I...

816
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:24,884
die?

817
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:37,271
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

818
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,775
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

819
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,373
I'm going to Tokyo.

820
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:57,791
What? Now?

821
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,293
Why?

822
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:00,794
A date.

823
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,130
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

824
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,174
Not my date.

825
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:08,469
I'll come home tonight.

826
01:13:11,347 --> 01:13:16,310
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

827
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,021
<i>He might not like it.</i>

828
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:30,866
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

829
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,952
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

830
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:35,329
<i>But what if we did?</i>

831
01:13:35,955 --> 01:13:40,334
<i>What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

832
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:41,085
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

833
01:13:44,213 --> 01:13:47,257
<i>he'd be a bit glad to see me?</i>

834
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:52,346
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

835
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:55,265
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

836
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:57,935
<i>But...</i>

837
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,855
<i>...one thing is certain.</i>

838
01:14:02,982 --> 01:14:06,694
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

839
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:10,781
<i>That you were the one who was inside me.</i>

840
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:14,702
<i>That I was the one who was inside you.</i>

841
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:16,537
I'm sorry.

842
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:48,902
Excuse me.

843
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:25,439
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I got to know you...</i>

844
01:15:29,318 --> 01:15:30,444
Taki.

845
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:32,946
Taki.

846
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:36,033
Taki.

847
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,203
Um... It's me.

848
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:43,791
Don't you remember me'?

849
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:46,460
Who are you?

850
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,633
I'm sorry.

851
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:01,975
<i>But he's Taki.</i>

852
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,978
<i>Weird girl.</i>

853
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:14,863
Hey!

854
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,366
What's your name'?

855
01:16:18,117 --> 01:16:19,034
Mitsuha!

856
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,995
My name is Mitsuha!

857
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:34,258
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

858
01:16:34,842 --> 01:16:36,468
<i>to see me!</i>

859
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:48,689
Ta ki'?

860
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:59,116
Mitsuha!

861
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:01,660
Ta ki'?

862
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:17,843
Mitsuha!

863
01:17:18,093 --> 01:17:21,847
You're here, aren't you'? Inside my body!

864
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:24,016
Taki!

865
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:26,518
Taki, where are you'?

866
01:17:27,269 --> 01:17:28,562
It's Mitsuha.

867
01:17:28,896 --> 01:17:30,814
I can hear her, but...

868
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:34,902
Taki, where are you'?

869
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:35,986
Taki!

870
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:51,418
Taki, are you...

871
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:54,213
there'?

872
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:20,906
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

873
01:18:35,963 --> 01:18:36,922
Mitsuha.

874
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:44,596
Taki.

875
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:49,393
Taki. It's really you.

876
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,648
Taki!

877
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:56,942
I came to see you.

878
01:18:57,317 --> 01:19:01,280
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

879
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:06,159
But how? At that moment, I...

880
01:19:06,285 --> 01:19:08,704
I drank your kuchikamisake.

881
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:14,668
You drank that?

882
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,170
You idiot! Pervert!

883
01:19:18,297 --> 01:19:21,258
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

884
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:23,343
How do you know that'?

885
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,095
Yotsuha saw it.

886
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:28,932
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

887
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:30,475
Just once?

888
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,438
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

Oh, this...

891
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,488
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you'?

892
01:19:43,864 --> 01:19:45,824
There's no way I'd recognize you.

893
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:49,369
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

894
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:51,955
Now you keep it.

895
01:19:53,749 --> 01:19:55,000
Yes.

896
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,217
How is it'?

897
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:06,511
Not bad.

898
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,055
You're lying!

899
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:10,515
No, I... Sorry.

900
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,060
You're really so...!

901
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:29,534
Mitsuha, you still have
things to do. Listen.

902
01:20:32,746 --> 01:20:33,622
It's coming.

903
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:36,666
Don't worry. You've still got time.

904
01:20:36,792 --> 01:20:38,627
Yes, I'll try.

905
01:20:41,088 --> 01:20:43,090

01:20:43,507 --> 01:20:44,716
<i>over.</i>

907
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:50,597
Hey, Mitsuha. So we don't forget
when we wake <i>up...</i>

908
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,730

Hey, Mitsuha?

912
01:21:25,215 --> 01:21:26,883
I wanted to tell you.

913
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:33,682
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll search for you.

915
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:43,358
It's OK. I remember.

Who are you?

919
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,757
Why did I come here?

920
01:22:08,842 --> 01:22:11,803
I came here to see her.

921
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,640
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

922
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:20,061
Who was it? Who?
Who did I come to see?

923

Someone dear to me. I don't want
to forget. I shouldn't forget!

He said sorry for breaking your bike.

01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:25,043
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

935
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:29,381
Explain everything to me later.

936
01:23:33,426 --> 01:23:36,054
That's going to fall? Really?

937
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,223
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

938
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:41,017
What? You saw it, huh?

939
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:46,231

<i>So the comet's nucleus split?</i>

<i>and the probability of a meteor crashing

1007
01:28:54,581 --> 01:28:56,165
<i>To predict the trajectory...</i>

1008

<i>That we're witnessing this live</i>

1010
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:07,218

- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

1023
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,788
Not you again...

1024
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:06,462

<i>This feeling has possessed me
for some time.</i>

1029
01:33:30,314 --> 01:33:32,108
I applied because...

1030
01:33:32,233 --> 01:33:33,609
The landscapes people live in...

1031
01:33:33,901 --> 01:33:35,611
To build a city's landscape...

1032
01:33:35,903 --> 01:33:39,907
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

1033
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:46,122
So I want to help build landscapes that
leave heartwarming memories...

1034
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:50,418
How many interviews have you had?

1035
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:51,627
I haven't kept track.

1036
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:54,088
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot!

1037
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:55,631
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1038
01:33:55,923 --> 01:33:57,633
We're not that different!

1039
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,886
- I have <i>2</i> job offers.
- I have 8.

01:34:11,856 --> 01:34:16,652
<i>or if I'm just searching for a job.</i>

1043
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,323
Oh, you're job-hunting.

1044
01:34:20,448 --> 01:34:22,491
I haven't had much luck.

1045
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:25,453
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1046
01:34:25,578 --> 01:34:27,496
Does it look that bad'?

1047
01:34:32,126 --> 01:34:34,420
What brings you here today'?

1048
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:39,425
I came nearby for work
so I figured I'd say hi to you.

"8 years
since the comet disaster"

1050
01:34:46,224 --> 01:34:49,518
You were still in high school, so it was...

1051
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:52,396
- 5 years ago.
- That long?

1052
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:55,858
Seems like I've forgotten a lot.

1053
01:34:57,235 --> 01:35:01,447
<i>I, too, no longer remember much
from back then.</i>

1054
01:35:02,907 --> 01:35:07,453
<i>Maybe we had a disagreement; the other two
returned to Tokyo without me.</i>

1055
01:35:08,246 --> 01:35:11,749
<i>I spent the night alone
on some mountain.</i>

1056
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:13,459
<i>That's about all I remember.</i>

1057
